# Solidworks-3dmodeling

In this repository, I am uploading simple 3D models that I have created to solve exercises for my upcoming exam. I am recreating exercises I previously completed from scratch as a practical revision method. I am happy to share these 3D models, and I hope they can be helpful to others.
